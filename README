Draws a sigma on the screen, just like the older
"sigma" example, but does so using multiple files
compiled together.

The program also demonstrates printing debugging
information to stderr, so you may want to redirect
stderr to a file for later viewing (or it may look
weird on the screen).

Read the Makefile, then compile using "make all"
